      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In principle, pending tasks can be managed and processed more easily
        with Join. It is possible to assign employees to specific tasks. It is
        particularly helpful to divide extensive tasks into subtasks and thus
        make the progress visible to everyone. Tasks can be provided with an
        expiry date and a priority, so that particularly urgent tasks are
        immediately in focus. Of course, all tasks can also be edited
        afterwards. The board provides an overview of all tasks and their
        processing status. Tasks can be moved between the different processing
        statuses using drag and drop. After logging in, the user can immediately
        see all tasks and their status. New contacts can easily be created in
        the contacts-section.

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        1) Create a new task under Add Task, or click the Add Task button on the
        board. Paste all content and save the task.
        <br /><br />
        2) Create subtasks and work through the task as intended. Drag the task
        to the appropriate processing status.
        <br /><br />
        3) Be happy when the task is completed. The next will come soon.
